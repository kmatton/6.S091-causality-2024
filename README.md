### Description

In this course, we will cover a selection of foundational topics in causality, as well as more recent topics
at the intersection of causality and machine learning. Two lectures will cover recent papers illustrating how
these topics are relevant to active areas of research.

In the **first section** of the course, we will discuss the identification of treatment effects, where a causal
model of a system is given, and then used to derive estimators for causal quantities such as (conditional)
average treatment effects. In the **second section** of the course, we will consider causal structure learning,
i.e., the estimation of an unknown causal structure from data. We will discuss limitations on the identifi-
ability of such structure from only observational data, algorithms for learning the structure for data, and
experimental design algorithms for learning structure using interventions. In the **final section** of the course,
we will discuss topics at the intersection of causality and machine learning, demonstrating how ideas from
causality can help to address open problems in machine learning such as out-of-distribution generalization.
